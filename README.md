# Web-Basics

## Introduction 
Hey guys, this is a short intro to learning some Basic Web Development; just incase you didn't catch the title.<br>
I've made this project because, I'm very passionate about Web Development. (Are you really?! ZOMG)<br>
This is targeted towards anyone who is curious about Web Development.<br>
Lastly, I believe that you only truly know something if you can teach it to others. <br>
Insert cheesy quote here --> ***In teaching others we teach ourselves.*** <--

## Purpose
I didn't make this so I can spoonfeed you Web Development, I made this so that you can feed yourself.
I'm simply leading by example, and letting you decipher these examples by providing you with the best resources I've come across.
I'm a self taught Web Developer and I've learned everything I know on my own.
Ofcourse some of you might be visual learners and some might be readers.
Regardless of the matter find your learning style, and stick to it.

**SIDE NOTE:** From what I've seen those who read know way more. <br>
**Noob:** But what do I read? <br>
**Me:** Well, theres tons of documentation of whatever you're trying to learn. The best developers aren't just great coders, they are  resourceful. <br>


## Getting Started

##Great Practice 
It's been known to be good practice to validate your code to meet the standards of Web Development. <br>
Upload any files that need Validation e.g *HTML,CSS,JS* [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload). <br>
